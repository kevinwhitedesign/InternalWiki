    <h2>Working with Sketch</h2>
    <h3>Duplicating Elements</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Repetitive tasks can be time consuming and melt away your design budget like ice cream on a sunny summer day.
        One of these repetitive tasks is duplicating elements and positioning the duplicates with exactly the same
        white space in between.</p>
        <p><strong>Quickly duplicate elements with alt + drag, or cmd + d.</strong></p>
        <p>Select an object, press alt and drag to create a copy. You may recognise this behavior from Adobe Photoshop
        and Illustrator, but no shit Sherlock, Sketch does it way better.</p>
        <p>Keep holding alt, Sketch will show you the exact distance between the duplicate, the original object, and
        the artboard. I use the alt key like a reflex to check whether my margins and paddings are consistent.</p>
        <p>Time for some shortcut power: press cmd + d. Now repeat this until you have the desired duplicates.
        Adobe Illustrator users will see familiarities with the 'step and repeat' function. Unfortunately Sketch doesn't
        support drag and repeat for radial distances yet.</p>

    <h3>Sorting Layers</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Quickly sort layers on text value or layer name with Sketch Mate plugin.</p>
        <p>Imagine you are building a dropbox-like app that needs a list of files in a folder. The files in this list
        can be sorted alphabetically or on the date it was added.</p>
        <p>You have wisely decided to avoid Lorem Ipsum dummy text and included some example content and you need to
        sort the list according to the actions.</p>
        <p>You can finish the puzzle yourself manually, but let's speed things up with the Sketch Mate plugin.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Sketch Toolbox.</li>
            <li>Search for 'Sketch Mate'.</li>
            <li>Install 'Sketch Mate'.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Sketch Mate is a combination of useful shortcuts. We will use the sort functionality that repositions
        layers based on Text or Layer Name.</p>
        <p>We want to sort the files list alphabetically. Duplicate the artboard and select the groups you want to
        organize.</p>
        <p>In the menu bar, go to Plugins > Sketch Mate > Sort > Sort Layers. In the current build there is a conflict
        between shortcuts. In the dialog screen, select 'Text (A>Z)'. If there are multiple text layers inside the group
        you will have to choose which text value you want to organize. Choose 'File Name' and click 'OK'. Watch your
        design finish itself in a blink of an eye.</p>
        <p>This also works for time values. A great technique for big dashboard designs.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Creating Symbols</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>To create your first symbol, select a group, or a number of layers and click the Creat Symbol icon in the toolbar.
        Alternatively, go to Layer > Create Symbol in the menu.</p>
        <p>If whatever you had selected wasn't yet a group, Sketch will group them together first. You now have a purple
        icon in the layer list and you can give your Symbol a new name in the inspector.</p>
        <p>Now you can go to Insert > Symbol, and insert a new instance of your Symbol into the canvas. Likewise you can
        copy-paste or duplicate an existing instance of a symbol and Sketch will link them together as well.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Organizing Symbols</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>If you create a lot of symbols in your document, you may want to group them together somehow, because a long
        list of symbols isn't that helpful.</p>
        <p>If you go to Insert > Symbol > Manage Symbols, you will get a dropdown sheet with a list of all the symbols
        in your document. You can rename or delete them there. If you include a slash (/) in the name of the Symbol, Sketch
        will treat these as group separators. For example, two Symbols named Button/Normal and Button/Pressed will be
        grouped together into a submenu called Button.</p>
        <p>Note that they are always sorted alphabetically, not in their order of creation.</p>
